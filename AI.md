CodeQuality immprovement: When I realized I had written a very lengthy methods follow my own logics, such that with deep nesting, I will call Claude for help to suggest me how to make the methods shorter and cohere with eg.SLAP.
It did work sometimes to help me point out some part where I can use a separate method to represent and reduce the LoC. However, sometimes It will suggest some approach that is totally different from my logic and result in bug (return different data type), which even result in extra work.
Sometimes, AI has better egle eyes than me, and help me found out the naming issue that I did not find out myself.

JavaDoc & Method Description: When I first tried out to write method description for my non-trial methods code, I found very lost. I tend to write very lengthy JavaDoc, despite that many words, I felt like I still could not express what and why the method is. I will send my code with JavaDoc to Claude and help me refine my JavaDoc Comment to a more clear and precise one.
It worked quite well, and with more example seen, I think I gradually understood how to write clear and precide JavaDoc
